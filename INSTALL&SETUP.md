# Polkasend APAC Hackathon Install and Setup Tutorial:

If you want to try our application on a mobile device, you will first have to download it at the following link.

Main App APK: [LINK](./WALLET_APK/app-release.apk)

Once inside that page, to download the app you will have to click on the download symbol on the right.

Because the application is not yet available on the playstore, you will have to activate the unknown sources.

After that, we will go to the file manager of our android and we will press on the app that we have just downloaded to install it.

Once the app is installed, the setup process is even easier. We just have to press Create New Wallet, Set Pincode, configure a 4-digit pincode, do not forget this pincode that you will not be able to change it for now and press set pincode again.

Finally, when you press the button, your mnemonic will be created, which is the only method to recover your wallet if you lose your cell phone, so keep it well, depending on the power of your smartphone, the creation of the mnemonic can take a few seconds up to 1 min, this is due to the generation of the mnemonic through the Ethers library.



The next step would be to fill out the Rapyd kyc for financial services, however, since this wallet is a POC, just press complete W/O KYC, this will take us to the lock screen that will always ask for the pin when opening the wallet.
